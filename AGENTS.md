# subiculum-rnn: instructions for coding agents

Project rules for Agent interaction are here, as well as brief context on the project. The bottom is a mapping to help describe where to find information based on goals.

## Project Goal

Does an axis-of-travel-like representation emerge in a vanilla RNN trained only to predict future position? A negative result is a valid outcome. Never optimize the pipeline toward a positive one. We are seeking to observe emergent properties within the RNN's latent space. This is based on work by Olsen et al. 2017. The paper that observed axis-of-travel tuning in subiculum neurons.

## Important Contextual Considerations When Working

1. Nothing that encodes axis of travel reaches RNN training: no axis labels,
   head direction, angular velocity, hand-coded travel direction, cell-type or
   cell-class labels. These stay in the data for validation, controls and
   post-hoc analysis. A control experiment that needs one must say so in its
   config.
1. Behavioral generation is validated on its own, against real behavior,
   before it feeds training. The model never shapes how behavior is generated.
1. Real behavioral recordings never enter the repository, the artifact store
   or the CLI. Their analysis happens outside; only aggregate statistics files
   reach the tool.
1. Every trained network is a model animal with a manifest: seed, configs,
   dataset, environment hash, commit, lockfile, checkpoints, metrics. Failures
   are kept. Seeds are never cherry-picked.
1. Artifacts are write-once, addressed by id and content hash, never modified
   in place. Explicit seeds and explicit RNGs, no global state.
1. Small code commits and simple code. Research code should be done via spec-driven design. No new dependencies without a
  reason validated by the authors.

## How work happens

- Spec-driven, one step at a time: `docs/<feature>/spec.md` (about 80-120 lines,
  out-of-scope written first) and validated by the authors before any other work is performed. Then `plan.md` (no code) is created to enure we are in agreement, and finally `tasks.md` (atomic, verifiable) which are mostly at the commit level so we can see the plan as it will be done in action. Implement one task at a time, tests with it as well, but only necessary tests, simplify the code and approach, and as a frontier model, you keep the state and goals, but have models, e.g. opus and sonnet, write the code and offer design choices that are simple, but you and the authors should be approving the design/architecture.
- `docs/` is light and committed: specs, plans, tasks, the data dictionary, reproduction steps. `tmp/` is uncommitted scratch for planning and working notes. `labnotebook/` is the author's dated log, i.e. do not write in it, delete, or modify its contents at all. Unless the authors ask and you receive double confirmation.
- Tests assert critical scientific and structural invariants, not exhaustive
  coverage, and never what a library already guarantees. Run `pixi run test`
  before claiming anything works.
- Standard idioms over cleverness. A docstring is one line of text on its own
  line between the quotes. A stub is a name, a help line and exit 3 until it
  is implemented; its arguments arrive with the implementation.
- Subagents may draft code or proposals. The session that dispatched them
  reviews the diff and runs the tests before anything is committed.
- Flag any choice that could change the scientific interpretation. Report
  exactly what changed and what was verified.

## Branches, commits and pushes

- All work happens on a branch named `agents/<topic>`, created from an
  up-to-date `main`. Never commit to `main` unless the authors ask for that commit.
- A finished branch is a PR candidate. It is never merged, and nothing is
  pushed to the remote, without the author's consent for that specific action.
- Commits are scoped to the task's files, one sentence commit messages each.
- Never delete branches, stashes or files outside the task without asking.

## Machine configuration

Author's own agent configuration (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`), shell and editor
settings and dotfiles are never changed by project work.

## Map

- `README.md`: what this is, how to run it, layout.
- `docs/cli/`: CLI spec, plan and tasks.
- `docs/reproduction.md`: setup, commands, versioning layers.
- `docs/research_plan.md` and `docs/data_dictionary.md`: phases, milestones,
  stored fields; arrive with the docs PR.
- `configs/`: declarative YAML; environments today, agents, datasets, models,
  training and experiments as they land. `configs/local.yaml` is the one
  machine-local file: paths only, git-ignored, never hashed.
- `src/subiculum_rnn/`: environments, store and cli today; behavior, datasets,
  models and analysis as they land.
- `tmp/planning/`: the full project overview and working notes, never committed.
